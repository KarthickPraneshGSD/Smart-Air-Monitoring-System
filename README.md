🌬️ Smart Air Monitoring System using Arduino
A compact, real-time air quality monitoring system that detects temperature, humidity, and harmful gases using sensors like DHT11 and MQ-135. Data is displayed on a 16x2 I2C LCD, making it perfect for small-scale indoor air monitoring.

🚀 Features
📡 Real-time air quality detection using MQ-135 gas sensor

🌡️ Temperature and humidity measurement using DHT11 sensor

📟 Live data display on a 16x2 LCD via I2C

⚡ Low-cost and beginner-friendly embedded system project

🧰 Components Used
Arduino UNO

DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor

MQ-135 Gas Sensor

16x2 LCD Display with I2C module

Jumper Wires, Breadboard, USB Cable

🧠 How It Works
DHT11 reads ambient temperature and humidity.

MQ-135 detects the presence of harmful gases like NH3, NOx, benzene, etc.

The readings are processed by Arduino UNO and displayed on the LCD screen.

Values refresh continuously to provide real-time updates.
